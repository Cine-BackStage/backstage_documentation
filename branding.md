**Slogan:** _No Drama._

## 🌟 Brand Essence

Backstage Cinema is a POS system for movie theaters that keeps the chaos off-stage.  
We bring together ticketing, concessions, inventory, and staff management into one  
smooth, customizable platform. Because running a theater shouldn’t feel like a horror flick.

## 🎯 Vision

To make every movie theater — from local screens to giant multiplexes — run smoother  
than a Tarantino monologue, with a system so intuitive it steals the spotlight.

## 💡 Core Values

1. **No Popcorn Drama** – Simple, unified, stress-free management.
2. **Flex Hard** – Fully customizable for any type of theater.
3. **Always Showtime** – Fast, reliable, and never “down for maintenance.”

## 🎭 Personality

Think of us as the “backstage crew” of cinema:  
invisible but critical, sharp, and maybe a little sarcastic.
